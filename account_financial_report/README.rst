This module adds a set of financial reports. They are accessible under
Invoicing / Reporting / OCA accounting reports.

- General ledger
- Trial Balance
- Open Items
- Aged Partner Balance
- VAT Report
- Journal Ledger

Currently General ledger, Trial Balance and Open Items are fully compatible with a foreign
currency set up in account in order to display balances. Moreover, any foreign
currency used in account move lines is properly shown.

In case that in an account has not been configured a second currency foreign
currency balances are not available.

Invoicing / Settings / Invoicing / OCA Aged Report Configuration you will be able to set
dynamic intervals that will appear on the Aged Partner Balance.
For further information, check CONFIGURE.rst

Configuration
=============

To configure dynamic intervals for Aged Partner Balance you need to:

Go on 'Settings' -> 'Invoicing' -> 'OCA Aged Report Configuration'.

Click on option 'Configurations' and create new record.

Create new interval.
The name established on line will be the column to display in Aged Partner Balance.
Inferior limit established on line is the interval

Example of configuration inferior limit:

-> 15
-> 30
-> 60

It means the first interval is from 0 to 15, the second from 16 to 30, and the third is 61+.

Go on 'Invoicing' -> 'Reports' -> 'OCA accounting reports' -> 'Aged Partner Balance'

When wizard is open, you need to select your interval configuration and print report.

If you want to get default interval configuration any time you wish to print Aged Partner Report,
you can set default interval configuration per company in:

'Settings' -> 'Invoicing' -> 'OCA Aged Report Configuration'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* 'VAT Report' is valid only for cases where it's met that for each
  Tax defined: all the "Account tags" of all the
  'Repartition for Invoices' or 'Repartition for Credit Notes'

* It would be nice to have in reports a column indicating the
  state of the entries when the option "All Entries" is selected
  in "Target Moves" field in a wizard

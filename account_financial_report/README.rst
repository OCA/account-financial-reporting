QWeb Financial Reports
======================

This module adds a set of financial reports. They are accessible under
Accounting / Reporting / OCA Reports.

- General ledger
- Trial Balance
- Open Items
- Aged Partner Balance
- VAT Report

Currently General ledger, Trial Balance and Open Items are fully compatible with a foreign
currency set up in account in order to display balances. Moreover, any foreign
currency used in account move lines is properly shown.

In case that in an account has not been configured a second currency foreign
currency balances are not available.

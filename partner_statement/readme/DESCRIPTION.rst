This module extends the functionality of Invoicing to support the printing of customer and vendor statements.
There are three types of statements: Activity, Detailed Activity, and Outstanding. Aging details can be shown
in the reports, expressed in aging buckets, so the customer or vendor can review how much is open, due or overdue.

The activity statement provides details of all activity on the partner receivables or payables
between two selected dates. This includes all invoices, refunds and payments.
Any outstanding balance dated prior to the chosen statement period will appear
as a forward balance at the top of the statement. The list is displayed in chronological
order and is split by currencies.

The detailed activity statement is an extension of the previous statement, and intends to explain the transactions
that have happened during the period, also providing with a Prior Balance section and an Ending Balance section.

The outstanding statement provides details of all outstanding partner receivables or payables
up to a particular date. This includes all unpaid invoices, unclaimed refunds and
outstanding payments. The list is displayed in chronological order and is split by currencies.

=================================

This project aims to deal with modules related to financial reports. You'll 
find modules that print legal and official reports. This includes, among 
others:

* One module based on webkit and totally rewritten by camptocamp, for standard
  financial reports.
* Another based on RML completely improved by Vauxoo.

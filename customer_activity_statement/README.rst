=================================
Print Partner Activity Statement
=================================

The activity statement provides details of all activity on the partner receivables or payables
between two selected dates. This includes all invoices, refunds and payments.
Any outstanding balance dated prior to the chosen statement period will appear
as a forward balance at the top of the statement. The list is displayed in chronological
order and is split by currencies.

Aging details can be shown in the report, expressed in aging buckets (30 days
due, ...), so the customer or vendor can review how much is open, due or overdue.

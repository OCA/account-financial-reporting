~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of the work for this release has been done at the Sorrento sprint

the weeks after.

* [IMP] hide button box in edit mode on the report instance settings form
* [FIX] Fix sum aggregation of non-stored fields (issue #178)
* [IMP] There is now a default style at the report level
* [CHG] Number display properties (rounding, prefix, suffix, factor) are
  now defined in styles
* [CHG] Percentage difference are rounded to 1 digit instead of the kpi's
  rounding, as the KPI rounding does not make sense in this case
* [CHG] The divider suffix (k, M, etc) is not inserted automatically anymore
  because it is inconsistent when working with prefixes; you need to add it
  manually in the suffix
* [IMP] AccountingExpressionProcessor now supports 'balu' expressions
  to obtain the unallocated profit/loss of previous fiscal years;
  get_unallocated_pl is the corresponding convenience method
* [IMP] AccountingExpressionProcessor now has easy methods to obtain
  balances by account: get_balances_initial, get_balances_end,
  get_balances_variation
* [IMP] there is now an auto-expand feature to automatically display
  a detail by account for selected kpis
* [IMP] the kpi and period lists are now manipulated through forms instead
  of directly in the tree views
* [IMP] it is now possible to create a report through a wizard, such
  reports are deemed temporary and available through a "Last Reports Generated"
  menu, they are garbaged collected automatically, unless saved permanently,
  which can be done using a Save button
* [IMP] there is now a beginner mode to configure simple reports with
  only one period
* [IMP] it is now easier to configure periods with fixed start/end dates
* [IMP] the new sub-kpi mechanism allows the creation of columns
  with multiple values, or columns with different values
* [IMP] thanks to the new style model, the Excel export is now styled
* [IMP] a new style model is now used to centralize style configuration
* [FIX] use =like instead of like to search for accounts, because
  the % are added by the user in the expressions
* [FIX] Correctly compute the initial balance of income and expense account
  based on the start of the fiscal year
* [IMP] Support date ranges (from OCA/server-tools/date_range) as a more
  flexible alternative to fiscal periods
* v9 migration: fiscal periods are removed, account charts are removed,
  consolidation accounts have been removed

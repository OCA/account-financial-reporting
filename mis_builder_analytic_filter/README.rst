===========================
MIS Builder Analytic Filter
===========================

This module extends the functionality of mis_builder to
provide filtering on analytic axis.

Installation
============

There is no specific installation procedure for this module.

Configuration and Usage
=======================

In Accounting > Reporting > MIS Reports, there is a new field
'Analytic Account' which can be used to filter move lines on an
analytic axis and it's children.

This filter is also available on the MIS Report widget, so the user
can change the filter in the preview and dashboard views.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* While useful as is, we are aware that such analytic filtering may need
  to be customized heavily depending on the customer context. This module can
  be extended or considered as an example.

* At the moment, no filtering is done on other queries than move lines.

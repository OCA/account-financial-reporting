This module extends the functionality of financial reports to support remembering
automatic sequence codes and to allow you to look for account moves afterwards,
being referenced by that official number.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Reporting > OCA accounting reports > Journal Ledger*.
#. Enable *Show auto sequence*.
#. Enable *Store auto sequence*.
#. Complete the wizard and generate the report.

Now the report contains a sequence, and those sequence numbers were stored in
the account moves.

If you go to *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Entries*, now you can:

* Display that field. It's a new hidden column.
* Quickly search for it.
* See it in the form view.

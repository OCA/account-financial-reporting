To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Reporting > OCA accounting reports > Journal Ledger*.
#. Enable *Show auto sequence*.
#. Enable *Store auto sequence*.
#. Complete the wizard and generate the report.

Now the report contains a sequence, and those sequence numbers were stored in
the account moves.

If you go to *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Entries*, now you can:

* Display that field. It's a new hidden column.
* Quickly search for it.
* See it in the form view.

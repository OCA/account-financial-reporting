========================
Intrastat Product Module
========================

This module contains common objects and fields for the Intrastat Product reporting, such as the *H.S. codes* (if you are not familiar with H.S. codes, read `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System>`) and the *country of origin* on the products.

It should be used in combination with country-specific Intrastat Product reporting modules
such as:

- *l10n_fr_intrastat_product*:
  the module for the *DÃ©claration d'Echange de Biens* (DEB) for France
- *l10n_be_intrastat_product*:
  the module for the Intrastat Product Declaration for Belgium

These country-specific modules can be found in the OCA localization for those countries.

Installation
============

WARNING:

This module conflicts with the module *report_intrastat* from the official addons.
If you have already installed the module *report_intrastat*,
you should uninstall it before installing this module.


Usage
=====

This module is used in combination with the country-specific
localization module(s).

Coding guidelines for localization module:
------------------------------------------

We recommend to start by copying an existing module, e.g. l10n_be_intrastat_product
and adapt the code for the specific needs of your country.

* Declaration Object

  Create a new class as follows:

  .. code-block:: python

     class L10nCcIntrastatProductDeclaration(models.Model):
         _name = 'l10n.cc.intrastat.product.declaration'
         _description = "Intrastat Product Declaration for YourCountry"
         _inherit = ['intrastat.product.declaration', 'mail.thread']

  whereby cc = your country code

* Computation & Declaration Lines

  Create also new objects inheriting from the Computation and Declaration Line Objects
  so that you can add methods or customise the methods from the base modules (make a PR when
  the customization or new method is required for multiple countries).
  
  Adapt also the parent_id fields of the newly created objects
  (cf. l10n_be_intrastat_product as example).

* XML Files: Menu, Action, Views

  Cf. l10n_be_istrastat_product as example, replace "be" by your Country Code.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Work is in progress to migrate the existing l10n_fr_intrastat_product module
to this new reporting framework, cf. Alexis de Lattre, Akretion <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>.
